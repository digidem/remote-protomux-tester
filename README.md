# remote-protomux-tester

A server for testing connections from @hyperswarm/secret-stream, hypercore, and protomux

This server is for testing remote connections to a socket listening for [noise handshakes](https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperswarm-secret-stream), [hypercore](https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore) replication, and [protomux](https://github.com/mafintosh/protomux) channels. We use it for testing Mapeo code for filtering remote connections (vs. local LAN connections).

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/digidem/remote-protomux-tester
npm install
```

## Usage

```
npm start
```

Server will start on port 3000 by default. To start on a custom port either:

```
npm start -- 4000
```

or

```
PORT=4000 npm start
```

## API

### Authorization

If you set the environment variable `AUTH_TOKEN` then the server will require that token to be sent in the `Authorization` header of the `/connect` request. In the following example, replace YOUR-TOKEN with a reference to your token:

```
curl --request POST \
--url "http://127.0.0.1:3000/connect \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
--data "{\"host\":\"127.0.0.1:1234\"}"
```

### `POST /connect`

**Request Body**

```json
{
  "host": "www.example.com:1234"
}
```

The server will make a TCP connection to the specified host, and attempt a Noise handshake (via [`@hyperswarm/secret-stream`](https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperswarm-secret-stream)), and will listen for any [`hypercore`](https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore) replication streams [muxed](https://github.com/mafintosh/protomux) into the stream, and also listen for a `mapeo/rpc` channel if created.

**Response Body**

```json
{
  // Whether the socket connected
  "socketConnected": false,
  // Any error reported on the server socket
  "socketError": null,
  // Whether the Noise handshake completed and successfully connected
  "noiseConnected": false,
  // An array of hex-encoded discovery keys of hypercores which were
  // replicated into the connection
  "discoveryIds": [],
  // Hex-encoded raw data received by the server on the socket
  "rawSocketData": "",
  // Whether a protomux channel with protocol 'mapeo/rpc' was opened
  "mapeoRpcConnected": false
}
```
